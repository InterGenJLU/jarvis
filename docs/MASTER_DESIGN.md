# JARVIS 2.0 - Master Design Document

**Status:** RETIRED (February 17, 2026)

This document was the original design spec from February 9, 2026. It became severely outdated as rapid development outpaced the document (still referenced Mistral-7B, listed completed features as upcoming, didn't reflect 15+ major features built Feb 11-17).

The original has been archived to `.archive/docs/MASTER_DESIGN.md`.
