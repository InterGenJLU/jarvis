# Audio Assets

The following `.wav` files are used as audio cues but are not included in the public repo:

- `ack_tone.wav` — Acknowledgment beep
- `conv_open.wav` — Conversation window opened
- `conv_close.wav` — Conversation window closed
- `error.wav` — Error notification
- `listening.wav` — Wake word detected
- `reminder_*.wav` — Reminder priority tones

Generate or provide your own WAV files (16-bit, 24kHz mono recommended).
